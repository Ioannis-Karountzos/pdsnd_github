The `bikeshare.py` was completed on **April 14, 2020** while the repo was created on **April 17, 2020**.

### Project Title
## Explore Bikeshare US Data.

### Description
In this project, we use data provided by _Motivate_, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.

Using `python`, we uncover bike share usage patterns for three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Specifically, after filtering for city and optionally, for month and day of the week, we calculate statistics about:
* **Time**, like the most common month, day and starting time.
* **Stations**, like the most popular stations and trips.
* **Trip duration**, total and average.
* **Users**, like the number of them, their gender, customer type and age.

We also give the user the option to display the raw data for each city.

### Files used
The files used for the analysis are `bikeshare.py` which contains the python code and the files containing the data for each city:
1. `chicago.csv`
2. `new_york_city.csv`
3. `washington.csv`

The .csv files are not included in the repository.

### Credits
The code was based on **Udacity**'s excellent **Introduction to Python**, as well as some worked examples on [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com).
