### Project Title
## Explore Bikeshare US Data.

### Description
In this project, we use data provided by _Motivate_, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.

Using `python`, we uncover bike share usage patterns for three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Specifically, after filtering for city and optionally, for month and day of the week, we calculate statistics about:
* **Time**, like the most common month, day and starting time.
* **Stations**, like the most popular stations and trips.
* **Trip duration**, total and average.
* **Users**, like the number of them, their gender, customer type and age.

We also give the user the option to display the raw data for each city.
